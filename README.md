# Campfire_Song-SBSP
I call this one, the campfire song song
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
Bum, bum, buuum...

I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
And if you want it, inside your soul
Just open up your heart, let music take control
